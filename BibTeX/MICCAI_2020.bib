abstract="Video is an essential imaging modality for diagnostics, e.g. in ultrasound imaging, for endoscopy, or movement assessment. However, video hasn't received a lot of attention in the medical image analysis community. In the clinical practice, it is challenging to utilise raw diagnostic video data efficiently as video data takes a long time to process, annotate or audit.  In this paper we introduce a novel, fully automatic video summarization method that is tailored to the needs of medical video data. Our approach is framed as reinforcement learning problem and produces agents focusing on the preservation of important diagnostic information. We evaluate our method on videos from fetal ultrasound screening, where commonly only a small amount of the recorded data is used diagnostically. We show that our method is superior to alternative video summarization methods and that it preserves essential information required by clinical diagnostic standards.",
